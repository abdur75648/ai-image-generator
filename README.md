# ai-image-generator
Generate artistic images using Neural Style Transfer Algorithm

Try deployed webapp - [Heroku (Depcrecated)](https://ai-image-generator.herokuapp.com) | [Render (Latest)](https://ai-image-style-generator.onrender.com/)

## Usage
* It is a Flask-based Web Application
* To make this practical, I've uploaded pre-trained models of some common styles (Because training the model everytime one wants to use this app requires much more resouces)
* You need to upload a content image and a style image of your choice.
* Submit & wait for few seconds. The output image will appear o the screen ðŸŽ‰
* Enjoy generating several cool images ðŸŽŠ
